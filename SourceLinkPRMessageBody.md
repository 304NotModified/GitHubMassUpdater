CSProj files have been updated to enable SourceLink in your nuget.
---

*This pull request was created with an automated workflow.*

I noticed that your repository and Nuget package are important for our .NET community, but you still haven't enabled SourceLink.

**We have to take 2 steps:**
1) Please approve this pull request and make .NET a better place for .NET developers and their debugging.
2) **Then upload the .snupkg file** to https://www.nuget.org/ (now you can find the snupkg file along with the .nuget file)

You can find more information about SourceLine at the following links
